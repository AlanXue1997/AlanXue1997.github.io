<center>

When you are old and grey and full of sleep

</center>
<center>

And nodding by the fire

</center>
<center>

take down this book

</center>
<center>

And slowly read

</center>
<center>

and dream of the soft look

</center>
<center>

Your eyes had once

</center>
<center>

and of their shadows deep

</center>
<center>

How many loved your moments of glad grace

</center>
<center>

And loved your beauty with love false or true

</center>
<center>

But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

</center>
<center>

And loved the sorrows of your changing face

</center>
<center>

And bending down beside the glowing bars

</center>
<center>

Murmur

</center>
<center>

a little sadly

</center>
<center>

how love fled

</center>
<center>

And paced upon the mountains overhead

</center>
<center>

And hid his face amid a crowd of stars

</center>
