>
>That is the question
>
>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
>
>The slings and arrows of infinite devil
>
>Or close eyes
>
>Blind to the expectation from beautiful angel
>
>And by ignoring hurt her. To die, to sleep
>
>No more; and by a sleep to say we end
>
>The thousand natural shocks
>
>That flesh in heir to. 'Tis a consummation
>
>Devoutly to be wish'd.
